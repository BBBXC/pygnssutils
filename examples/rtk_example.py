PLEASE RESPECT THE TERMS OF USE OF ANY NTRIP SERVER YOU
USE WITH THIS EXAMPLE - INAPPROPRIATE USE CAN RESULT IN
YOUR NTRIP USER ACCOUNT OR IP BEING TEMPORARILY BLOCKED.

This example illustrates how to use the UBXReader and
GNSSNTRIPClient classes to get RTCM3 RTK data from a
designated NTRIP server and apply it to an RTK-compatible
GNSS receiver (e.g. ZED-F9P) connected to a local serial port.

GNSSNTRIPClient receives RTK data from the NTRIP server
and outputs it to a message queue. A send thread reads data
from this message queue and sends it to the receiver. A read
thread reads and parses data from the receiver and prints it
to the terminal.

For brevity, the example will print out just the identities of
all incoming GNSS and NTRIP messages, but the full message can
be printed by setting the global PRINT_FULL variable to True.

If the receiver is a u-blox UBX receiver, it can be configured
to output RXM-RTCM messages which acknowledge receipt of
incoming RTK data and confirm whether or not it was used (i.e.
RTK correction applied).

NB: Some NTRIP servers may stop sending RTK data after a while
if they're not receiving legitimate NMEA GGA position updates
from the client.
