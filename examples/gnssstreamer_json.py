pygnssutils - gnssstreamer_json.py

This example illustrates how to use GNSSStreamer in
conjunction with a text File as an external output handler
to create an array of GNSS messages in JSON format.

The file will be written to the user's HOME directory
by default, and can be read by any JSON parser.
