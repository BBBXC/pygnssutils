### RELEASE 0.1.0-alpha

1. Initial public release of combined Python 3 GNSS utility library which consolidates the common capabilities of three existing GNSS libraries: `pynmeagps` (NMEA), `pyubx2` (UBX) and `pyrtcm` (RTCM3)
2. `pynmeagps`, `pyubx2` and `pyrtcm` will continue to be developed as independent libraries for their respective GNSS protocols, but functionality which is common to all three - as well as other useful generic GNSS functions - will be incorporated into `pygnssutils`.
